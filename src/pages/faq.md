          SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization.


          Take as an example the last time you looked for something on Google,
          Yahoo, Bing, Baidoo, Yandex, DuckDuckGo, Qwant etc, you get a list of
          listings that we call "results". These results are ranked by the
          search engine depending on the search query of your potential
          customer... and which website the search engine thinks is most
          relevant to serve the user's intent.


          *   So you'd want to be visible


          *   Preferably but not necessarily on the first page


          *   For that important query


          *   You'd want your potential customer to click on your link


          *   Then arrive to your page and get served quickly (2-3 seconds page
          load time on mobile ideally)


          *   And you'd want them to take an action such as stay on your website
          to read or watch something, to buy something, or return on a next
          visit, or subscribe, etc.




          So the more people convert, the better for your business and your
          website in the eyes of a search engine.

        question: What is SEO?
      - question: How long does it take to start getting results?
        answer: >
          It depends. 


          For example, little tweaks to a fairly large e-commerce site that has
          been live for a while can bring in results within weeks, (but even
          that is not a guarantee).


          For a brand new website, with little content, it can take longer. 


          The better you plan from the start, the easier the task. 


          In a nutshell :


          *   One size does NOT fit all.

          *   A typical scenario : Planning it takes 1-4 weeks, implementing the
          first batch of enhancements (Urgent and important) takes 2-4 weeks,
          measuring and continuous enhancement is a medium/long term activity.

          *   Once implemented, SEO enhancements bring you the benefit for years
          to come.
      - question: Do you guarantee your SEO work?
        answer: >
          Yes and no.


          I'll explain: We guarantee what we control, and an overnight change of
          the algorithm is not one of them.


          We just don't take shortcuts. 


          If you face an SEO expert who guarantees their results, ask them more
          questions (to say the least).
      - question: I found better prices elsewhere
        answer: >
          We work independently with no office rent to cover and no investors to
          please, so we can keep our prices very affordable to small and medium
          businesses; but if you found a better alternative with better prices
          for your business you should probably go for it.  


          We believe that this industry's main cost is time and experience. Two
          things we offer abundantly to our customers.
