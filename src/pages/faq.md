          Now that’s a frequent one all right. SEO stands for Search Engine
          Optimization. Take as an example the last time you looked for
          something on Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidoo, Yandex, DuckDuckGo, Qwant
          etc, you get a list of listings that we call results. These results
          are calculated by the search engine depending on the search query of
          your potential customer... and which website the search engine thinks
          are most relevant to serve the user.


          *   So you'd want to be visible


          *   Preferably but not necessarily on the first page


          *   For that important query


          *   You'd want your potential customer to click on your link


          *   Then arrive to your page and get served their answer quickly (2
          seconds)


          *   And you'd want them to do an action like to stay on your website,
          to buy something from you, or return on a next visit, or read
          something or subscribe, etc.


          So the more people do that, the better you will convert. And to reach
          there, we implement a strategy that starts by auditing what you
          already have.
        question: What is SEO?
      - question: How long does it take to start getting results?
        answer: >
          It depends. For example, little tweaks to a fairly large e-commerce
          site that has been live for a while can bring in results within 1 to 3
          weeks. For a brand new website, with little content, it can take
          months. In a nutshell : 


          *   One size does NOT fit all.

          *   A typical scenario : Planning it takes 1-4 weeks, implementing the
          first batch of enhancements (Urgent and important) takes 2-4 weeks,
          measuring it is a full time and medium/long term activity.

          *   But once implemented, SEO brings you the benefit way after the
          implementation, and for years to come. Email me at riad@webforgood.fr
          and we’ll talk about it all, no commitment whatsoever.
      - question: Do you guarantee your SEO work?
        answer: >
          Yes and no. I'll explain: We guarantee what we control, and an
          overnight change of algorithm is not one of them. If you face any SEO
          who guarantees results 100%, ask more questions.
