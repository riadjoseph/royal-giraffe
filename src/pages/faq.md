          Now that’s a frequent one all right. SEO stands for Search Engine
          Optimization. Take as an example the last time you looked for
          something on Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidoo, Yandex, DuckDuckGo, Qwant
          etc, you get a list of listings that we call results. These results
          are calculated by the search engine depending on the search query of
          your potential customer... and which website the search engine thinks
          are most relevant to serve the user.


          *   So you'd want to be visible


          *   Preferably but not necessarily on the first page


          *   For that important query


          *   You'd want your potential customer to click on your link


          *   Then arrive to your page and get served their answer quickly (2
          seconds)


          *   And you'd want them to do an action like to stay on your website,
          to buy something from you, or return on a next visit, or read
          something or subscribe, etc.


          So the more people do that, the better you will convert. And to reach
          there, we implement a strategy that starts by auditing what you
          already have.
        question: What is SEO?
      - question: How long does it take to start getting results?
        answer: >
          It depends. For example, little tweaks to a fairly large e-commerce
          site that has been live for a while can bring in results within 1 to 3
          weeks. For a brand new website, with little content, it can take
          months. In a nutshell : 


          *   One size does NOT fit all.

          *   A typical scenario : Planning it takes 1-4 weeks, implementing the
          first batch of enhancements (Urgent and important) takes 2-4 weeks,
          measuring it is a full time and medium/long term activity.

          *   But once implemented, SEO brings you the benefit way after the
          implementation, and for years to come. Email me at riad@webforgood.fr
          and we’ll talk about it all, no commitment whatsoever.
      - question: How do you handle sensitive customer information?

          am I right? Make sure you’re as transparent as possible with your data
          handling process. Or, if you’re using Snipcart, just refer to [our ToS
          and DPA](http://bit.ly/2YJwlyt).

          opening up the JAMstack to more developers. Plus, we trust these
          folks. [Read more about Stackbit](http://bit.ly/2YAvGix). <br /><br />
          Q: How many people work at Snipcart? <br /> A: Not a lot! We’re a
          small, bootstrapped team of eight human beings. Michael might be a
          robot, though. <br /><br /> Q: Why is Snipcart based in Québec City?
          <br /> A: Have you been here? It’s beaaautiful! <br /><br /> Q: What’s
          the meaning of life? <br /> A: We’re not quite sure. But building
          useful products with people we love feels meaningful enough.
